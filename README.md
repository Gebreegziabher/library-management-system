# Library Management System

This system is developed for the purpose of a course project at Maharishi International University, USA.

Library management system is a simple java project where a librarian adds books, checks out books for students and tracks due dates. This system has a beautifully designed user-interface, which doesn't resemble the native Swing Java UI.

The GUI(graphical user interface) is primarily developed using Java Swing.

## Functionalities

* Admin role manages users; register user, delete user, disable user. 
* Librarian manages books; add books, checkout book for students, track due date of checked out books
* Master role: a role combining the capabilities of both admin and librarian
